# Examining World Trends: A Data Narrative

We explore the complex relationship between time, health, and economic prosperity in this data discovery adventure. Our dataset, which covers a wide range of nations and years, offers a wealth of undiscovered insights.

# 1. Life Expectancy in Different Countries

We start our voyage with a map showing life expectancy in various nations. We produce a map that graphically illustrates life expectancy at birth using geographic data. The range of life expectancies is represented by the colour gradient, which goes from blue to red, with blue denoting lower values and red greater values. We are able to identify trends and differences in life expectancies around the globe thanks to this visualisation.

# 2. Economic Situation: The Top 10 Nations with the Lowest GDP Per Person

Turning our attention to economic data, we list the ten nations that will have the lowest GDP per person in 2022. We illustrate these countries with a bar chart that provides an overview of their economic conditions. The graph offers a comparative perspective, highlighting the glaring disparities in economic development between countries.

# 3. Examining Correlates: GDP per Person against Life Expectancy

We then start investigating the connection between life expectancy and GDP per capita. We can see how these two variables interact with a scatterplot. A linear regression line and scatterplot provide information about whether longer life expectancies are correlated with more economic success. This examination clarifies the complexinteraction between health outcomes and economic considerations.

# 4. The Development of Economic Wealth

Lastly, we go on a temporal tour of the GDP per capita's historical development. We plot the trend of economic prosperity for different countries throughout time using a time-series graphic. We can see long-term patterns, trends, and oscillations in economic development thanks to this visualisation.

# In a synopsis

Our path of data research has provided a comprehensive understanding of world patterns. We have gained insights into the intricate mechanisms forming our world through mapping life expectancies and tracking economic evolution, among other projects. We have converted unstructured data into useful insights by utilising data visualisation techniques, which has allowed us to make more informed decisions and gain a better understanding of the world around us.
